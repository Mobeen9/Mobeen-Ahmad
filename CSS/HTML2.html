<h2> Batting in Cricket</h2>
<p>In cricket, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)/"target="_blank"> batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs and prevent the loss of one's wicket. Any player who is currently batting is, since September 2021, officially referred to as a batter (historically, the terms "batsman" and "batswoman" were used), regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries - therefore, as well as having outstanding physical batting skills, top-level batters will have quick reflexes, excellent decision-making and be good strategists.    </p>

<Bowling</h3>
<p style="color:red ;"> Bowling in cricket refers to when a player - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the bowler' propels the ball towards the stumps that a batsman is defending. In terms of objectives, bowlers aim to either take wickets (the act of dismissing batsmen by hitting the stumps with the ball) or to prevent run scoring opportunities.</p>
