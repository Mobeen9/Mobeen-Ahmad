<div class="div8"> OUR STORY</div>
<br>
<p><img class="img6" src="/HTML/indian-food-2021-10-21-04-03-18-utc.jpg"> Group was established in 2008 as we aspired to bring a top-notch South Asian dining experience for the foodies of the South West. For being exceptional and outstanding in what we do, we are often copied, but we are the original service provider and bear no relation to any similarly named establishments. Our name and restaurant theme are from our Mughal inspiration; we have brought an edge to the grand grade listed Georgian cellar by blending Mughal and contemporary Indian cultures.</p>
